	`Sakiya’s agricultural program’s mission is to revive traditional cooperative farming practices as rooted in Palestinian ‘masha’ or Commons as an integral part of cultural production. As such our vision of Agri-Culture production, as stated in our Strategic Plan, seeks “Liberation through a society whose confidence is rooted in traditional and contemporary ecological practices, whose tolerance echoes nature’s diversity, whose generosity springs from collective labor, whose creativity is enriched by the intersections between art, science, and agriculture and whose prosperity is shared beyond boundaries.”
	Sakiya takes an ecosystemic approach to its agricultural and cultural production to mitigate effects of climate change to which monoculture agriculture highly contributes. Sakiya aims to contribute to essential agricultural knowledge, promote and encourage guild practices and crop diversification eliminating the need for pesticides and chemical fertilizers where different crop groups create a support system to fight pests and diseases. Sakiya aims to work through incubating projects/initiatives/farmers whose work is based on ecological and permaculture practices enabling the creation of models ready for emulation.</p>`
